# tracer_upwelling_paper - Under construction!

This repository contains MITgcm configurations and post processing scripts and notebooks to reproduce the results presented in the paper *Tracer upwelling through a submarine canyon*, submitted to JRG-Oceans. It is divided into:

* **experiments** - Data files and modified MITgcm routines for each run.
* **postprocessing** - Notebooks and scripts used to calculate transports, upwelled tracer and water onto the shelf, extracting $$\rho$$ and tracer profiles, etc.
* **figures** - Notebooks used to generate the figures presented in the paper.
* **input_files** - All binary fles required to rerun the experiments (initial temperature, salinity, tracer concentration, vertical diffusivity, and bathymetry files) 

Some notebooks and scripts require modules from [canyon_tools](https://bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/canyontools/src/09f475f551444184dc76645b2a233de04b9a3bea?at=default).
